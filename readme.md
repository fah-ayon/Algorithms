# CSE 221: Algorithms

Welcome to the CSE 221: Algorithms repository! This repository is designed to help students understand efficient algorithm design techniques and analysis, as covered in the course. It includes various resources, including lab assignments, practice sheets, theory assignments, and past exam questions.

## Course Description
CSE 221 focuses on the study of efficient algorithms and the design techniques used to develop them. Topics include:

- Analysis and design of algorithms
- Divide and Conquer, Greedy Method, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking
- Basic search and traversal techniques
- Graph algorithms (shortest paths, depth-first search, network flow)
- Integer arithmetic (gcd, primality), polynomial and matrix calculations
- NP-hard and NP-complete problems
- Performance bounds, asymptotic analysis, worst-case and average-case behavior
- Sorting and searching algorithms
- Amortized analysis and lower bound theory

The course includes a compulsory 3-hour laboratory session every alternate week. **Pre-requisite**: CSE 220.
